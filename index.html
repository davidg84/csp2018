    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;"> My name is David, my hobbies are taking pictures and skating.
    Sometimes I babysit my two little sisters. 
    When I'm not home I'm either out with my friends or out taking pictures. 
    I'm also really into comicbook movies and videogames. 
    My plan is to graduate with a bachelors and pursue a career in the Navy.</p>
